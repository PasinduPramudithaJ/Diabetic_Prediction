# Diabetes Prediction Using Neural Networks

This project uses a dataset of medical symptoms to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes using a neural network built in PyTorch.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `src/` contains modular Python scripts
- `data/` has the input dataset
- `outputs/` saves the trained model and results
- `main.py` runs the full training and evaluation process

## ðŸ§  Model
A fully connected neural network with 2 hidden layers using ReLU and sigmoid for binary classification.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
